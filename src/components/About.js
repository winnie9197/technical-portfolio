                Q: Who are you?
                <br/><br/>
                I’m a 2020 recent graduate from the Statistics program (ML/Data Mining stream) from the University of Toronto.
                <br/><br/>
                I’m passionate about many things and would give it all to achieve them. It all started under an influence. Ever since high school, I’ve been teaching myself different technologies. I’ve spent a year or so with nonprofits to mentor and teach underrepresented students Machine Learning and coding. Did I mention I’m also a professional dancer/choreographer?

                Q: What would you want to achieve with Full stack development?
                <br/><br/>
                My vision: I’d like to contribute my efforts to make society a better place for everyone to live. Translating this to full-stack development, my goal is to create safe, inclusive, comfortable spaces where anyone would feel at home browsing. Websites can be better than just business tools.
